## Current Status & Next Steps

- **Core functionality (Trilobot motors, basic camera, web movement) is verified.**
- **PS4 Controller Issue:** Controller connects but actions don't seem to be processed correctly. Debug logging added to `ps4_controller.py`.
- **Camera Stream Issue:** Stream stops working after initially loading. Debug logging added to `web_control.py` stream generator.
- **Voice System Blocked:** Still requires user to install `SpeechRecognition`, `PyAudio`, `elevenlabs` via pip in the venv.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. **User Action:** Run `pip install SpeechRecognition PyAudio elevenlabs` in the activated venv on the Pi.
  2. **Run Application:** Execute `./run_trilobot.sh`.
  3. **Test & Observe:**
     - Check if the camera stream stays active.
     - Test PS4 controller buttons and sticks, observe log output (especially `DEBUG` logs related to PS4 events and actions).
     - Listen for the startup voice announcement.
  4. **Report Findings:** Provide the relevant log output, specifically focusing on camera stream logs and PS4 controller logs (raw events, processed actions, warnings).
